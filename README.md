# Fraud-Detection
The Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning project aims to build a model that can identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. By utilizing various machine learning techniques and algorithms, this project can analyze patterns in transaction data and detect anomalies that may indicate fraudulent activity. The model can be used in industries like finance, e-commerce, and banking to safeguard against fraud and protect users from financial loss.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw data into a suitable format for model training.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from the dataset to improve model accuracy.
- Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, etc.) to train a model on labeled data.
- Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
- Real-Time Prediction: Deploys the model to predict fraudulent transactions on new, unseen data.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
1. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. NumPy: For numerical operations.
3. Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
. Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
5. XGBoost (optional): For gradient boosting models.
## Dataset
The project uses transaction data, typically available in a CSV format, with the following columns:
- Dataset download link : https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BiTEaQ6MM3OXku8EhDoCa9EGhHmIuCGM&export=download
- Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
- Transaction_Type: Type of transaction (e.g., purchase, withdrawal).
- Customer_ID: Unique identifier for the customer.
- Timestamp: Date and time of the transaction.
- Label: A binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).
Note: A publicly available dataset such as the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset on Kaggle can be used for training the model.

## Steps
## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Import the dataset.
- Handle missing values, if any.
- Normalize numerical features.
- Encode categorical variables.
## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions.
- Check for outliers and anomalies.
- Identify correlations between features.
## 3. Model Selection & Training
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Tune model hyperparameters using cross-validation.
## 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC curve.
- Compare model performances and choose the best one
